Bugs (yes, I know there's an issues page on GitHub):
* Page does not immediately refresh when adding a new card.

Todo:
* Need to display existing picture when we tap on existing card
* Need to add a way to insert pictures (pictures need to be saved as /images/FirstnameLastname.jpg. e.g. if the name is "Federico Paredes", it will search for /images/FedericoParedes.jpg")
* Need a default picture to display for when user does not upload picture
