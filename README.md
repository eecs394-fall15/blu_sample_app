Bugs (yes, I know there's an issues page on GitHub):
* Page does not immediately refresh when adding a new card.

Todo:
* Need to add a way to insert pictures (pictures need to be saved as /images/Firstname Lastname.jpg. e.g. if the name is "Federico Paredes", it will search for "/images/Federico Paredes.jpg")
* Need to implement a way for the image name to change when cards are edited (specifically when the name is edited).
